The screens in the UI have been designed with [GraphicsGale](https://graphicsgale.com/us/)
- Install the GraphicsGale software
- Install the font Bm437_Portfolio_6x8_modBUK.FON provided in this folder.

In GraphicsGale under new file, 
- Set the canvas to 128x64 (or your screen size)
- When drawing text, set the font to "Bm437 Portfolio 6x8"

The rest is pretty straight forward.
