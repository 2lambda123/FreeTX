This folder contains the source code of the firmware for the main (mtx) and secondary (stx) transmitter microcontrollers, as well as the receiver microcontroller.  
I highly recommend browsing or editing the code with an editor such as Visual Studio Code or Notepad++.  
If you are using the legacy Arduino 1.8.x IDE, you also need to enable the "Use external editor" option.
For VScode, simply open the folder (e.g. mtx) as project. For notepad++, use the "Open folder as workspace".
